This is the project conducted by group10, based on dash.plotly, using real-world dataset to create a local interactive Web interface, in a total of 366 observations.
More sepcificicaly, we focus on the analyse of "The Demand of Rental Bikes During year 2012 in Capital Bikeshare System" by visualizing 
as a plimitory research.


**research object**:
with three qualitative variables:

    *season*: season (1:winter, 2:spring, 3:summer, 4:fall)

    *holiday*: weather day is holiday or not
    
    *weathersit*:
        1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
        2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
        3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
        4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog

and quantitatve variables selecting from:

    *temp*: Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in hourly scale)

    *atemp*: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (only in hourly scale)

    *hum*: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)

    *windspeed*: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)

    *cnt* (more in a dependent variable sense for mldm): count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

Look how easy it is to use:

    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()
